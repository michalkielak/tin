If you always use an outbound proxy, you will never need 
the -r command line parameter!!!

Otherwise use the -r command line parameter to control,
if requests are sent to the host given in the 
- to-URI, if -r is set 
- register-to URI,  given you are registered to that host
  and if -r is not set
Be aware, both destinations may be overidden by the maddr or lr
parameters.

Point to point calls are not influenced by this flag.

If you want to use this feature on a call by call base, 
precede the URI with ## in the dial window.
