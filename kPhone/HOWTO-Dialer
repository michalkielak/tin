The Dialer is a little remote dial command line application,
start it with 
   kpsidial URI
or 
   kpsidial type URI
   
URI is your sip phonenumber with or without domain part

type is a one char string:
a  audio
v  audio+video
o  video only
1  first external session type
2  second external session type
3  third external session type
4  fourth external session type
For URI and the sessiontypes an how to handle them, see the user manual

The dialer is initially inactive, you activate it from 
 Preferences->SipPreferences->Settings->Remote Dialer.
It is necessary to restart kphone after the change.
 
If the kphone broke, dialer's socket should be cleared by hand:
    rm /tmp/kpsidg

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The dialer is experimental software, don't curse the kphone team, if it will
not operate perfectly on your PC! Report your experience!
