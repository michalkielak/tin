KphoneSI (kpsi) 1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

KphoneSI (kpsi)  is a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) user agent 
for Linux, with which you can initiate VoIP (Voice over IP) connections 
over the Internet, send Instant Messages, subscribe your friends' 
presence information and start other applications of your choice

The KphoneSI is an extention of the KPhone (http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/)

The original KPhone was written by Billy Biggs, the latest version by Pekka
Raisio, Jouni Vuorela and Juha Heinanen at Wirlab with suggestions and
fixes from the KPhone community around the world.

The KPhone SI is written by Klaus Fleischmann with various contributions 
from others and is still in development.

This software package is tested on different Linux brands, gcc up to gcc 4.2.1
works well. Currently srtp crashs on 64-bit maxchines

This software package comes with NO warranty. You should note that by
downloading, compling and installing it you agree to full self
responsibility.

Note: "This program is released under the GPL with the additional
exemption that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed."


How to make and receive  a call with KPhone?
=============================================
When starting kpsi for the first time, you should enter your identity 
information in the window appearing. The information required for 
successful sipping are: 'Full Name', 'User part of SIP URL' and 
'Host part of SIP URL'. Filling the 'Outbound Proxy' Field is recommended,
possibly necessary. Study you provider's documentation for the details.
The field should contain your proxy's IP address or that of a Media Gateway
if used. If your provider demands authentication, the Authentication user' id
may be entered here, too. The password is asked for in a special popup-window 
Mark the auto register selection if you wish kpsi to automatically register 
your identity on application start. If you want to use multiple identities, 
start KPhone SI with the '-u' option and the username of your selection.

If you are behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) device, you should go 
to Preferences->SIP-Preferences->Socket and check the 'Use STUN Server' and 
specify the STUN server's IP address.

To start a call you type the SIP-URI and then select the call type (audio, 
video, ...) A started call is displayed in the 'Session Info' window, right
clicking an entry pops up a window with the controls for that call. This 
is also the place where you release the call (hangup entry).

An incoming call shows up in the 'Session Info' window, too. It is painted 
red. To accept the call, double click that window.


Compilation hints
=================

KphoneSI (kpsi) requires various programming libraries and header 
files (Qt, OpenSSL et al) to be present in the system. 

The source comes with two srtp subdirectories. srtp is newer but may not compile 
on older systems. Renaming srtp-1.4 to srtp and using srtplib v1.4.0 will possibly help!
BE AWARE, srtp could crash on 64-bit systems

Features which are conditional code:
------------------------------------
* Thread usage. Use always, if possible. The default is enabled.

* Speex, the default is enabled, exclude it from compiling with --enable-speex=no on 
 the configure cmdline

* Internationalisation, the default is disabled, include it to compiling with
  --enable-lipo=yes on the configure cmdline

* SRTP, the default is disabled, include it to compiling with --enable-srtp=yes
 on the configure cmdline

* Presence: user activity detection. The default is disabled, include it to compiling 
 with --enable-presact=yes on the configure cmdline

* Support of big endian machines. The default is disabled , include it to compiling 
 with --enable-endian=yes on the configure cmdline

* Debugging support. The default is disabled, include it to compiling with 
 --enable-debug=yes on the configure cmdline 

Before compiling:
-----------------
Please read INSTALL !!! There you find a step by step compile guide.

The use of KPhoneSI.kdevelop and doxyfile. 
_________________________________________
Both script files use absolute paths! If you do not use /usr/local as base directory,
displace it with your choice.
  
Using KDevelop and doxygen with KPhone:
=======================================
The scripts KPhoneSI.kdevelop and Doxyfile assume your sources are /usr/local/src.
Check if you have to adapt this to your locations.
