We have two external ringing devices:
 - kphoneringsh
 - kphonering


kphoneringsh
============

This shell script accepts two arguments:

- the ALSA audio device as default or hw:x,y (x ist device number, y the subdevice number,
  hw:0,0 - o.k. if you have one card - is preselcted )
- the file to be played

It uses alsaplay to play the tunes. It can be adapted easily to be used
with an other app than alsaplay (see handbook)


kphonering
============

kphonering accepts two arguments:

- the file to be played
- the OSS audio device (i.e. /dev/dsp)

Depending on these it plays

- beeps if there are no arguments or the first argument is default
- music if a wav-file is the first argument

The sound device defaults to /dev/dsp

The files are repeated with a short break of 1 sec
